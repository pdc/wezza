This displays weather information from forecast.io.

## Next steps

My plan for the front page would be to have a location picker made from a
geocoding service (I was thinking of using Bing’s) plugged in to the
jQuery UI autocmplete widget; I have done this before as part of the
registration and profile UI on photorowd.com.

I also had planned to turn the temperature and rain data in the forecast in to
bar charts using Raphaël or similar.

A real production app wouild use a CDN to serve its static assets.
